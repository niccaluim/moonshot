        <h1>Moonshot</h1>
        <p>This is the transcription of the Apollo ll flightcrew communications
            as recorded on the command module (CM) data storage equipment
            (DSE), and subsequently transmitted (dumped) to Manned Space Flight
            Network stations. Magnetic tapes containing dumped voice and onboard-recorded
            ground elapsed time (GET) were forwarded to the NASA Manned
            Spacecraft Center, Houston, Texas. Transcription of these tapes was
            managed by David M. Goldenbaum, Test Division,
            <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/apollo/missions/">Apollo Spacecraft Program Office</a>,
            to whom questions regarding this document should be referred.</p>

        <p>In the text, a series of three dots (…) is used to designate
            those portions of the communications which could not be transcribed
            because of garbling. <span class="note">This publication replaces MSFC-MAN-507
            dated 15 August 1969 for vehicle SA-507.</span class="note"> One dash (-) is
            used to indicate a speaker's pause or a self-interruption. Two dashes
            (- -) are used to indicate an interruption by another speaker or a
            point at which a recording was abruptly terminated.</p>
